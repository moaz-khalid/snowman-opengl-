-Project Overview

This project is a 3D Snowman rendered using OpenGL and GLUT.
The snowman is built from basic 3D geometric shapes (spheres and a cone) and includes:

. Three snow body spheres

. Eyes and a carrot nose

. Lighting and depth testing

. Automatic rotation animation

. Interactive mouse-controlled rotation

The program demonstrates basic 3D modeling, transformations, lighting, animation, and mouse interaction using the OpenGL fixed-function pipeline.


-Technologies Used

. C++

. OpenGL

. GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)

. GLU (OpenGL Utility Library)
